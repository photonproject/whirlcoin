It uses an algorithm new to cryptocurrency, and an equally innovative reward system set to follow a polynomic function.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# WhirlPool Algorithm\r\n\r\nWhirlCoin uses a new algorithm called Whirlpool. This algorithm utilises the Merkle–Damgård construction based on AES, created by one of AES' creators.It has remaind open cource and without patene since its release.\r\n\r\nThe Wirlpool algorithm is fast and efficient. It has an average speed of 57Mib/s, almost as fast as SHA-256 and much quicker than most algorithms used by cryptocurrencies. Whirlpool is also energy efficient, allowing both miners and clients to work to a higher capacity.\r\n\r\nWhirlCoin implements SHA-256 alongside Whirlpool for added security; Each hash has one round of Whirlpool and one of SHA-256.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Rewards\r\n\r\nWhirlCoin's rewards follow the function of -sqrt(x/347)+100, resulting in a gradual descent starting at 100 and descending towards 10 over 4 years.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Specifications\r\n\r\n**45 Second Block Times**\r\n\r\n**Difficulty readjustment every block**\r\n\r\n**Total supply of 17,000,000 WHRL**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
